    <h3>This is the game Evens and Odds</h3>
    <p>For those unfamiliar with the game, here's a quick break down:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The game is generally played between two players and begins with one of the two players choosing Evens or Odds.</li>
        <li>Then the two players throw out a number of fingers between 1 and 5.</li>
        <li>The number of fingers between the two players are added up and if the result is even, the player who chose Evens wins. If the result is odd, the player who chose Odds wins.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Let's say player 1 chooses Evens.</li>
        <li>The two players throw out their hands with a random number.</li>
        <li>Player 1 throws out the number 2.</li>
        <li>Player 2 throws out the number 3.</li>
        <li>2 + 3 = 5, which is an odd number and since player 1 chose Evens, player 1 loses.</li>
    </ul>
